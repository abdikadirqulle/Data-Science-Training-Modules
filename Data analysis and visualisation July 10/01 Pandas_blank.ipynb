    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Pandas provides easy and powerful ways to import data from a variety of sources and export it to just as many. It is also explicitly designed to handle *missing data* elegantly which is a very common problem in data from the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used to perform the same tasks that you might use spreadsheets such as Excel for: columns of data being combined together with functions being applied to them and finally being displayed as a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The offical [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) is very comprehensive and you will be able to answer a lot of questions in there, however, it can sometimes be hard to find the right page. Don't be afraid to use Google to find help.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start off with a quick overview of how we can use Pandas to read a file, ask some questions of it and plot the results. Then, in the next few chapters, we will dive into each of these topics in more detail."
