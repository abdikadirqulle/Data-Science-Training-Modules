    "Well done for getting this far! We've covered a lot in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- The `print()` function\n",
    "- Basic data types: strings, floats and integers\n",
    "- Indexing, slicing and appending to lists\n",
    "- Reading Python errors\n",
    "- Branching logic using `if` statements\n",
    "- Looping over different data structures such as lists, ranges, dictionaries and files\n",
    "- Using `range()` and `enumerate()` to loop in different ways\n",
    "- Creating, modifying and accessing dictionaries\n",
    "- Reading files using `open()` and the `with` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not expected to have comitted all of this to memory already, learning any programming language takes more than three hours. It is only by continuing to use Python and practise that you will become confident. These notes will remain online so feel free to refer back to them at any time."

    "### One last challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's end this session with a more difficult challenge. We're going to make a calculator which can read numerical operations from a file and print the answers to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by making a file called `calc.txt` with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "4 * 6\n",
    "5 + 6\n",
    "457 - 75\n",
    "54 / 3\n",
    "4 + 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have the spaces between each number and the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a code which reads in that file and performs the mathematical operations listed. It should output something like:\n",
    "  ``` python\n",
    "  4 * 6 is 24\n",
    "  5 + 6 is 11\n",
    "  457 - 75 is 382\n",
    "  54 / 3 is 18.0\n",
    "  4 + 6 is 10\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - There are some extra functions you will need to do this. Firstly, [the `split` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) which takes a string and returns a list containing the string, split by spaces. Secondly, you may need [the `strip` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip) which removes any whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, including removing newlines.\n"
